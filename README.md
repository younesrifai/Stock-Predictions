This project's goal is to apply machine learning models to try to predict stock movements. I will be testing it out with different variable combinations. Currently still a work in progress, will be pushing out updates at each milestone </br>

Done: </br>
Scraped Yahoo Finance Data for data enrichment. </br>
Gathered past 2-5 years of financial data for a number of stocks in each of the 3 indexes (S&P 500, Dow 30, Nasdaq 100) </br>

Work in Progress: </br>
Convert non-numerical data to numericals </br>
Build ML Model </br>

Future improvements: </br>
Add a feature to use scraper in Yahoo Finance + LLM model to give a score per stock based on news articles </br>
