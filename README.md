This project's goal is to apply machine learning models to try to predict stock movements. I will be testing it out with different variable combinations. Currently still a work in progress, will be pushing out updates at each milestone

Done:
Scraped Yahoo Finance Data for data enrichment.
Gathered past 2-5 years of financial data for a number of stocks in each of the 3 indexes (S&P 500, Dow 30, Nasdaq 100)

Work in Progress:
Convert non-numerical data to numericals
Build ML Model

Future improvements:
Add a feature to use scraper in Yahoo Finance + NLP to give a score per stock based on news articles
